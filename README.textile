h2. About this repository

The main distribution branch is located at http://mxunit.googlecode.com/svn/mxunit/trunk/ (SVN)

This repository is the development branch for MXUnit 2.0. This _should be_ a mirror of http://mxunit.googlecode.com/svn/mxunit/branches/MIT

This repository is here to (1) help distribute MXUnit to as many people as possible (like those who prefer Git), (2) to work on MXUnit 2.0 in a Git environment, and (3) to explore what it takes to keep a Git and SVN repository in synch.
