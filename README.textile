h2. About this repository

The main distribution branch is located at http://mxunit.googlecode.com/svn/mxunit/trunk/ (SVN)

The Git(hub) repository is the development branch for MXUnit 2.0; aka the "MIT" branch. This _should be_ a mirror of http://mxunit.googlecode.com/svn/mxunit/branches/MIT

This repository is here to (1) help distribute MXUnit to as many people as possible (like those who prefer Git), (2) to work on MXUnit 2.0 in a collaborative Git environment, and (3) to explore what it takes to keep a Git and SVN repository in synch.

The presence of MXUnit here _does not_ indicate that MXUnit is moving from Google Code to Github.

h2. Collaborating Guidelines

Patches and improvements are always welcome! Please fork this branch, make your changes (with plenty of passing tests) and make a pull request. 

Test and Be Happy!
